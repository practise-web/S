The rapid growth of academic literature has made it increasingly challenging for students and researchers to efficiently access relevant information. Traditional search engines often return fragmented results based solely on keyword matching, which can slow down research and reduce productivity. \textit{Scholar Mind} is a context-aware academic assistant designed to address this challenge by integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.
\\\\
The system allows users to input research questions or keywords and retrieves the most relevant scholarly documents while providing concise summaries and insights. By automating document search and contextual understanding, Scholar Mind minimizes manual effort, enhances research efficiency, and supports informed decision-making. This project demonstrates how AI-driven tools can bridge the gap between information availability and actionable knowledge, offering a smarter, faster, and more intuitive approach to academic research.
